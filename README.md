Hayamker is a framework for building and running algorithmic trading strategies via [Interactive Brokers' TWS API](https://ibkrcampus.com/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/ "Interactive Brokers API"). It's build on top of [ib_insync](https://ib-insync.readthedocs.io/ "ib_insync").

Primary functionality is:
- downloading data
- data research
- building and running algorithmic trading strategies
- backtesting those strategies [not working now]

It's still work in progress...
